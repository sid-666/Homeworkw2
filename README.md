# Homeworkw2
Week 2 homework repo
For this weeks homework we were asked to come up with a mobile responsive website, tailored specifically to design specifications provided through the given images.
We had to create a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images.
During this task I ahd to refer back to the knowledge I had thus far gathered in html semantics, css styling (mainly grid layout and media queries), and the use of external sources such as bootstrap.
Through the assistance of having a third party styling data base such as bootstrap the formation of the navbar and of the contact details input space was relatively easy.
However, difficulties were faced in trying to conduct personal styling as on many instances my choices have been overrun by bootstraps predermined styling settings.
In creating the portfolio of images tested my knowledge of grid layout. I utlised a three row with two column layout (following the images provided) to situate my photos in. 
I had to also utilize my knwowledge of box spacing as well to properly format and situate my images into the grid.
Creating the About me page was quite simple. I did not face too many difficulties in that. All that was required was to have text surrounding a floating image (based upon the image).
I was able to accomplish that due to the practice we gained during past activities in class. In CSS we just had to state that the image to float left and the text surrounded the image from the right.

This was my experience with the HW.
